/* 
  Example use of openCV to acquire and display images from file and from a video camera
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  This application reads a sequence lines from an input file imageAcquisitionInput.txt.
  Every line contains
  
  1.  a camera number (typically 0 for the internal webcam and 1 for an external USB camera)

  When display from the camera is terminated by the user (by pressing any key), 
  the last image to be acquired is written to a file 'camera_image.png'
  and the cycle repeats until all filenames from the input file have been read.

  It is assumed that the input file is located in a data directory given by the path ../data/ 
  defined relative to the location of executable for this application.

  (This is the application file: it contains the client code that calls dedicated functions to implement the application.
  The code for these functions is defined in the implementation file. The functions are declared in the interface file.)
