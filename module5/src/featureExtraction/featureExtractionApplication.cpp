/* 
  Example use of openCV to perform 2D feature extraction
  ------------------------------------------------------
 
  This application reads a sequence lines from an input file featureExtractionInput.txt.
  Each line contains a filename of an image to be processed. 

  It is assumed that the input file is located in a data directory given by the path ../data/ 
  defined relative to the location of executable for this application.

  The imput image is converted to greyscale, automatically thresholded, and the connected components are identified.
  The following features are then computed using find_contours():

     Bounding rectangle
     Convex hull
     Convex cavities
     Hu moments

  The features for each image are written to the output file.

  (This is the application file: it contains the client code that calls dedicated functions to implement the application.
  The code for these functions is defined in the implementation file. The functions are declared in the interface file.)
